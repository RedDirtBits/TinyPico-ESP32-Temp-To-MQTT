# TinyPico Temperature To MQTT

A simple project set up for the purpose of testing power consumption of the TinyPico while reading room temperature and humidity and publishing to MQTT

# Purpose

This is parallel project of my [ESP32 Temperature](https://github.com/RedDirtBits/ESP32-Temp-To-Pushover.git) project in which room temperature was read then sent via WiFi to the Android Pushover service.

The [TinyPico](https://www.tinypico.com/) differs from the garden variety [Espressif ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) in that it uses the ESP32 D4 and is specifically built to minimize power consumption
